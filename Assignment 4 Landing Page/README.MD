# Tech Startup Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page for a tech startup, built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It features a hero section, key product features, team members, and a contact section.

## Features

- **Responsive design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid system.
- **Smooth scrolling**: Scrolling between sections is smooth, thanks to the `scroll-behavior: smooth;` CSS property.
- **Hover effects**: Interactive hover effects are applied to the feature cards and team cards to enhance the user experience.
- **Bootstrap integration**: The page leverages Bootstrap 5 for layout, components, and responsive behavior.
